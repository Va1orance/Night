## Preface
Welcome to the design ramble of Night(s). This is a family of layouts I created - originally under one design theory, but shifted to each their own later down the line.
This is going to be a long ramble, so I'll just share what most people will want to know here.

Do I recommend this layout? Yes, I made it to be good after all. This isn't one of the many meme layouts I make for min-maxing (optimizing for one specific statistic) and overall follows good design.
Here is the **basic** summary:

Night
- Great SFBs
- Great Alternation
- Good (-1) Finger Positions
- Decent SFSs

Nightingale
- Great SFBs
- Good Alternation
- Decent Finger Positions
- Decentish SFSs

Nights
- Great SFBs
- Decent Alternation
- Decent SFSs
- Okay Finger Positions

If you want to learn why there are three, when one clearly seems better than the rest, read on!

## Theory Preface
Before I discuss about the two design theories of the Night family, I have to talk about how they came to be. I **strongly reccomend you read this** as if you disagree, these layouts are probably not optimal for you. I design these layouts for me, and my style of typing; if you have a similar style to mine, you may like this; if you don't that's okay! Just know these layouts may not be so suited to you.

At this point, I have reached 160+ WPM twice, 140+ WPM thrice, and 120+ WPM quadrice.

## Design Theory
So, clearly, Night seems like the best... right? Well, here's the thing. The Night family originally came about due to two design theories:
- **Finger movement.**
- **Finger-finger interactions.**

**Finger movement** is pretty simple. When we type fast, we don't want the fingers to move very far. This just causes more time to be wasted. It's been done before, but not quite with the integration as I have done here (i.e. with modern layout designs).

**Finger-finger interactions** is a bit more complicated.
The best way I can describe this is how your fingers interact with one another. If you are on QWERTY, put your middle finger on E and your index on C. Alternate as fast as you can between the two (ececececec). Next, move your index up to R. Alternate as fast as you can between the two (ererererer). Both of these are pretty comfortable to be honest, but which one feels easier to alternate fast on? Probably ER right?

In the alternative layout community, fingers being placed in opposite positions are regarded as scissors (the example I gave isn't usually considered one due to index being so flexible). I personally do not believe scissors have too much importance - most can be resolved with a simple posture change or small wrist movement - but of course if we can avoid these, might as well.

But all in all, these two design theories (combined with the classic SFBs and SFSs) narrows down to a layout that should perform well at fast typing.

These two layouts culminated in the design of Nightingale and Nights. We will explore each layout in depth when we get there. However, first, we need a basic layout. 

# Basic Layout
Before we get into optimizing for the theory, I first needed a basis, a homerow. I was tempted to use Stern (I still really really like STH).
But, it had a two main problems:
- S repeats commonly enough that it's annoying for a pinky to be doing "SS"
- T being on the index is fine, but still a lot of usage with D added.

The reason I used this in the first place was because S paired well with F or V, allowing a mostly low movement pinky, and TH being an inroll. If I wanted to keep this, I would have to run something like NSTH. If this is all you wanted, you could easily do with a simple index swap to Dusk (add link here:tm:):
```
x f d ' j  q p o u .
n s t h m  y c a e i
b v k l z  w g _ / ,
      r                 
```
In fact, this isn't such a bad idea, and I would give it a shot if you wanted TH onehand. 

But here's where the theory comes in. We want fingers going in the same direction (minimizes both finger movement and finger-finger interactions). On an effort map, most of the keys agree that extending (i.e. top row) is better than curling (i.e. bottom row; except index). So, we should make a layout that has as **little** bottom-row usage as possible. There are a few ways to do this, but the best way I found was NSHT.

**TBD**
