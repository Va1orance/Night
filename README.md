## Preface
Welcome to the design ramble of Night(s). This is a family of layouts I created - originally under one design theory, but shifted to each their own later down the line.
This is going to be quite long, so I'll just summarize here:

The Night layout family are alternative keyboard layouts designed for thumb alpha keyboard layouts. 

**Nightingale**
- Nightingale takes advantage of the columnar staggering of the keys by allowing one's fingers to maintain close proximity with one another. This creates a comfortable typing experience at high speeds - akin to how one's fingers would rest on a mouse. 

Night is a modification of Nightingale that incorporates a more traditional approach to design.

Statistic wise, the Night family primarily focuses on minimizing SFBs and bad redirects. 
These however, are just the basics; the following will be the process of how Night came to be.

**Special terms such as SFBs, SFSs, redirects, etc. can be found within the "Terminology" section.**

## How, What, Where, When, **Why?**
At this point, I have reached 160+ WPM twice, 140+ WPM thrice, 120+ WPM quadrice, and 100+ WPM a good few times. Going through so many layouts, I had to learn, relearn, adapt, undo, among many other things, on each layout. However, each time I approached those top speeds, one particular skill had to be learned: chording. 

Also commonly referred to as chunky typing, this method involves learning/memorizing common sequences of letters (such an OU; as in "you", "could", "would", etc.) or even whole words instead of typing l e t t e r  b y  l e t t e r . 

In MY learning, I noticed that learning these chunks/chords were easier when they feature natural directions of movement (i.e. typing QWE QWE QWE over WQE WQE WQE) and feature fingers that are in close proximities (i.e. QWE QWE QWE over QXC QXC QXC (type C with middle)) along with the typical SFB optimizations. 

These factors translates roughly into these metrics:
- Minimal bad redirects (normal redirects have minor effects)
- Maximal same row usage (this will help keep all the fingers together)
- "Minimal finger movement" - will be discussed at a later section
- Minimal 2U SFSs
- Minimal SFBs

Overall, this should narrow down to a layout that feels comfortable at high speeds.

# Basic Layout
Before we get into optimizing for the theory, I first needed a basis, a homerow. I was tempted to use Stern (I still really really like STH).
But, it had a two main problems:
- S repeats commonly enough that it's annoying for a pinky to be doing "SS"
- T being on the ring is fine, but a little much with D and K added on.

The reason I used STH in the first place was because S paired well with F or V, allowing a mostly low movement pinky, and TH being an inroll. If you want to maintain this, you can run NSTH. A simple index swap to Dusk would suffice (add link here:tm:):
```
x f d ; j  p y o u .
n s t h m  g c a e i
b v k l z  q w ' / ,
      r
(this isn't Nightfall)
```
This layout idea was originally picked up by Brownfox and you can check out his layout series Nightfall on cmini.

However, this layout does not address the theory goals mentioned in the section above.
In order to accommodate for the appropritate letter stacks (discussed in the next passage), NSHT was chosen as the consonat homerow.

Along with the letter stacks, this setup enables repeat S to be moved away from the pinky, and moves the high frequency T to the index. *More details later...*

## Layout Basics Part 2
Now that we settled on the homerow, what about the consonant stacks (we will do vowels)? First, we have to decide on whether top row or bottom row is better. This is still a form of debate, layout families like Hands Down prefer the lower row. However, in my opinion, the top row is superior due to:
- Middle up is a very comfortable and ideal position while bottom is rather poor comparatively.
- Ring up is a comfortable and ideal position while bottom is
questionable to most.
- Pinky and index up or down generally both accepted (index down favoring) or minor in effect.

Through this, top-row likely would be preferred. 

Now after tinkering with many many layouts, a few special column setups come to mind.
- DTK alike to Dusk, Stern, Nightfall. Good SFBs and very minimal SFSs.
- LHM alike to Dusk, Stern, Nightfall. Good SFBs, but rather high SFSs.
- PNB alike to SNTH/SNTHR/SNTHRF. Good SFBs, but PN causes rather high SFSs.
- FSV alike to Dusk. Good SFBs, acceptable SFSs.

*Layouts mentioned are by no means a comprehensive list, it is simply for reference.

With these preliminary setups, the problem with NSTH is revealed due to the reliance on an LHM index (otherwise the good positions are wasted). Hence, a simple TH swap into NSHT allows us the freedom of the high use T index. So, to just throw everything together:
```
b f l d
n s h t
p v m k
      r
```
*already looking familiar...*

Now yes, I will still be using an R thumb. The short reason for this is that it simply has the best stats. R interacts rather terribly with every other key and thus the best position would be to isolate it to the thumb.

Now quite accidentally, we setup LD being right next to each other. If you do little digging, you will find a lot of layouts using T which place the D in the bottom position. This is because the index curling position is regarded as one of, if not the best non-homerow positions.

However, this LD setup is great as there are a lot of words with LD ("would", "could", etc.) which follows are design theory of close fingers. That being said, there are some pretty obvious issues with the rest of the layout: 
- BNP pinky is horrendous in movement.
- M is a rather common key, going against our same-row theory.
- Rest of the index keys are not utilized.

This is pretty bad, but let's fill in the rest of the keyboard first.
```
b v l d q
n s h t j 
p z m k x
      r    
```

## Index Sorting
