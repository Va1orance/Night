## Preface
Welcome to the design ramble of Night(s). This is a family of layouts I created - originally under one design theory, but shifted to each their own later down the line.
This is going to be a long ramble, so I'll just share what most people will want to know here.

Do I recommend this layout? Yes. "Duh", I made it. This isn't one of the many meme layouts I make for min-max (optimizing for one specific statistic) and overall follows good design.
Here is the **basic** summary:

Night
- Great SFBs
- Great Alternation
- Good (-1) Finger Positions
- Decent SFSs

Nightingale
- Great SFBs
- Good Alternation
- Decent Finger Positions
- Decentish SFSs

Nights
- Great SFBs
- Decent Alternation
- Decent SFSs
- Okay Finger Positions

For most people, just go with Night. There's a reason I'm not explaining the depth here, as it won't really affect you. But, if you want to learn why there are three, when one clearly seems better than the rest, read on!

## Design Theory
So, clearly, Night seems like the best... right? Well, here's the thing. The are two original design theory of the Night family. They are:
- **Finger movement.**
- **Finger-finger interactions.**

Finger movement is pretty simple. When we type fast, we don't want the fingers to move very far. This just causes more time to be wasted. It's been done before, but not quite to the level I have done here (at least I think).

Finger-finger is a bit more complicated.
First, what does this mean? Well (if you are on QWERTY), put your middle finger on E and your index on V. Alternate as fast as you can between the two (evevevevev). Next, move your index up to R. Alternate as fast as you can between the two (ererererer). Both of these are pretty comfortable, but be honest here *i know your gonna be biased if you know effort maps*, which one feels better? Probably, ER right?

In the alternative layout community, this finger opposite location interaction(one extend, one curl, vise versa) is known as a scissor (this specific example, index middle, most don't consider a scissor). Scissors are mostly (changing now) regarded as feeling less "comfortable." **Buttt... The thing is, I don't really buy it.** 

With the exception of a few extreme ones, I don't really think scissors actually have that much of an effect on typing - especially at fast speeds. Considering wrist movement, posture, etc. most scissors will simply disappear or be masked by bigger issues. 

**However,** what you may also have noticed while spamming the two keys like your playing a rhythm game, is that ER probably felt a bit more natural to alternate fast. **Two fingers being in the same extended or curled position together often feels better interacting.** This is the second theory of Night.

*The former contains my **opinion** of scissors because I want to clarify this isn't a layout designed to minimize scissors (even if it indirectly does). It probably actually has a lot of half-scissors.*

These two layouts culminated in the design of Nightingale and Nights. We will explore each layout in depth when we get there. However, first, we need a basic layout. 

# Basic Layout
Before we get into optimizing for the theory, I first needed a basis, a homerow. I was tempted to use Stern (I still really really like STH).
But, it had a two main problems:
- S repeats commonly enough that it's annoying for a pinky to be doing "SS"
- T being on the index is fine, but still a lot of usage with D added.

The reason I used this in the first place was because S paired well with F or V, allowing a mostly low movement pinky, and TH being an inroll. If I wanted to keep this, I would have to run something like NSTH. If this is all you wanted, you could easily do with a simple index swap to Dusk (add link here:tm:):
```
x f d ' j  q p o u .
n s t h m  y c a e i
b v k l z  w g _ / ,
      r                 
```
In fact, this isn't such a bad idea, and I would give it a shot if you wanted TH onehand. 

But here's where the theory comes in. We want fingers going in the same direction (minimizes both finger movement and finger-finger interactions). On an effort map, most of the keys agree that extending (i.e. top row) is better than curling (i.e. bottom row; except index). So, we should make a layout that has as **little** bottom-row usage as possible. There are a few ways to do this, but the best way I found was NSHT.
